# devops-nodejs
Sample app to demo how to build and test Node.js apps with Azure DevOps Pipelines.

Setting up an Azure DevOps pipeline is not too complicated. On this tutorial,
let's learn how to setup a simple pipeline to a basic Node.js app so we can build,
test and capture test results and report code coverage analysis, exposing them to
everyone in the team.

On this tutorial we will:
* Create a new DevOps Pipeline
* Build our project
* Configure DevOps to read the outputs of our tests and test coverage
